goals include but are not limited to:

1st run:

auto player model lookup in the engine,
addition of missing ui buttons (decal.........)
replace all art(except badges, tesseract, sauerbraten)
add exporters for blender into repo.
possible auto lookup of textures / and models(we will see)
texture config tools
modify blender scripts for model config creation on export.

2nd run:

bring monsters back

3rd:

implement bullet phys,
use python as scripting engine.


basicaly try to convert this already awesome engine into something easy for my kids to mod and have fun with.

my additons to this code will most likely be quite ugly,
but if you need to use it, it will fall under the parent code license, 
just make sure to keep the badges(which will include one for 3) and links to the projects your work is based upon.

my modifications will be clearly marked with why and //angelo

this readme will be updated with what i have done.

thanks
